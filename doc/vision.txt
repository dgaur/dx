* General Project Vision *


This is the basic project "vision" that I've been pursuing.  It's not
terribly radical or innovative; but I deliberately chose this path to make
the project more interesting/educational and to explore some different
technologies.

	A small, vaguely desktop- or workstation-oriented operating system.
	Liberally borrow ideas from Linux, Windows, L4, others; but there is no
	specific intent or goal to mimic any of those systems in particular.
	Support for basic desktop or workstation hardware.

	A small, simple microkernel.  Kernel stability is highest priority, even
	at the expense of system performance or user features.  Make the basic
	system services available to user space applications/drivers; but
	otherwise stay out of the way.

	Applications in user space.  The common tongue, in user space, should be a
	single HLL/VM: Python or possibly Parrot.  Drivers in user space, too,
	where possible (although these probably still in C).

	User space logic is inherently untrusted, even drivers.  For this reason,
	minimize (avoid) any kernel dependencies on user space features or drivers.
