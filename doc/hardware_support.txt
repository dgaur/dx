* DX Hardware Support *

This document describes the current list of required + supported hardware
(which is fairly dated at this point).


Required:
	- An Intel Pentium Pro (P6) or later CPU
	- An Intel 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)
	- An Intel 8254 Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT)
	- At least 64 MB of RAM.  Currently, this is an artificial restriction,
	  since the entire OS image (kernel image, kernel heap, user image, etc)
	  will easily fit within 8MB.
	- A 8042 (or 8741/8742/compatible) keyboard controller
	- An MF-II US keyboard
	- A VGA-compatible video controller


Optional:
	- A 16550-compatible UART on COM1.  This is only necessary in the kernel
	  debug build (when the kernel serial console is enabled).


Other:
	- Uni-processor only.  Should run normally on an SMP machine, but will
	  only take advantage of one processor.  @@this is untested


Virtualization:
	- The .iso and .vfd images should both work under VMware Player, VirtualBox,
	  Microsoft Virtual PC, Bochs, etc.  See the sample files under
	  $(DX_ROOT_DIR)/etc.
