*** Compliance with POSIX (IEEE 2003.1), Single Unix Specification (v3) ***


In general, POSIX support is minimal.  Only enough to support Doug Lea's
malloc().


Decoder:
	COMPLETE	-- All types + routines are implemented; should work normally
	INCOMPLETE	-- The header and/or implemenation is incomplete.  Some types
				   or routines may not be defined or implemented.
	ABSENT		-- This header/implementation is provided at all.



errno.h			-- COMPLETE.  Defines C99 errno and all standard error values.

sys/types.h		-- INCOMPLETE.  Provides size_t.  Nothing else.

unistd.h		-- INCOMPLETE.  Provides sbrk(), which isn't actually part of
				   the POSIX standard.  Nothing else.
