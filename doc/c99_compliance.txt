*** Compliance with C99 ***


In general, the libc implementation here is minimal and only provides partial
support for C99; it is not a full implementation at all.

Note that the libc is *SHARED* between the kernel and user applications.  The
kernel uses some of the standalone library routines (e.g., memcpy, memset,
etc).

The C99 NDEBUG macro is automatically defined in the retail build; not defined
in the debug build.

Decoder:
	COMPLETE	-- All types + routines are implemented; should work normally
	INCOMPLETE	-- The header and/or implemenation is incomplete.  Some types
				   or routines may not be defined or implemented.
	ABSENT		-- This header/implementation is provided at all.



assert.h		-- INCOMPLETE.  Provides partial/incomplete definition of
				   assert().

complex.h		-- ABSENT.

ctype.h			-- COMPLETE.

errno.h			-- COMPLETE.  Defines errno, EDOM, EILSEQ and ERANGE.  Also
				   defines the standard POSIX error codes as well.

fenv.h			-- ABSENT.

float.h			-- ABSENT.

inttypes.h		-- ABSENT.

iso646.h		-- ABSENT.

limits.h		-- COMPLETE.  All limits defined.

locale.h		-- INCOMPLETE.  All types and routines are defined, but none
				   are implemented.

math.h			-- INCOMPLETE.  All types and routines are defined, but none
				   are implemented.

setjmp.h		-- COMPLETE.  All routines implemented.

signal.h		-- ABSENT.

stdarg.h		-- COMPLETE.  Defines all va_* macros, but relies on GCC
				   implementation due to optimization errors.

stdbool.h		-- COMPLETE.  Defines bool, _Bool, true and false.

stddef.h		-- INCOMPLETE.  Defines only ptrdiff_t, size_t and NULL.

stdint.h		-- INCOMPLETE.  intN_t, uintN_t, intptr_t and uintptr_t types
				   defined.  Other types not defined.

stdio.h			-- INCOMPLETE.  All routines defined, but not all implemented.
				   I/O structures are incomplete.

stdlib.h		-- INCOMPLETE.  All routines defined, but not all implemented.
				   Includes itoa() and uitoa() as extensions.  abs(), min(),
				   max() are all defined as macros.

string.h		-- INCOMPLETE.  All routines defined, but not all implemented.
				   Includes strrev() as an extension.

tgmath.h		-- ABSENT.

time.h			-- INCOMPLETE.  Defines time_t, clock_t, struct tm.  All
				   routines defined, but none implemented.

wchar.h			-- ABSENT.

wctype.h		-- ABSENT.
