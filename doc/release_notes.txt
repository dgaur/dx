* DX RELEASE NOTES *



* PENDING-RELEASE:
	Minor fixes to the release process itself.  No actual changes to the OS
	logic.


* Version 0.0.1, released 2009-08-16:
	Initial public release on kenai.com.  Basic micro kernel; some user mode
	libraries; couple of user mode executables.  Sole interface is a very
	simple shell.  No other functionality.  Not useful yet.

	Appears to be stable(?) on basic 32-bit x86 UP platforms.  Includes support
	for basic VGA (text mode only); and (incomplete, very limited) support for
	PS/2 keyboards.  The debug kernel writes output to COM1, 9600 8N1.
