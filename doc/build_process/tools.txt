* DX Tools *

DX should build cleanly with the following tools (most of these are
included in the default FC14 build).  Other tools or tool versions may
also work, but are probably untested.


* GNU bash, version 4.1.7(1)-release (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)

* gcc version 4.5.1 20100924 (Red Hat 4.5.1-4) (GCC)

* GNU ld (GNU Binutils) 2.20.51.0.7-6.fc14 20100318

* GNU Make version 3.82

* debugfs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)

* genisoimage 1.1.10 (Linux)

* Doxygen version 1.7.1
