This directory contains various libraries incorporated into the kernel and
user executables.

Some of these libraries are 3rd-party, open-source code, under separate
copyright and license from the rest of the dx source.  Changes to this code are
handled via the patches in this same directory.  The tarballs themselves should
match those distributed by the original authors.  See dx/README for additional
notes on 3rd-party source.
